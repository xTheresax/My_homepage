<h1>*Chapter 0:In the fall</h1>
<p>I left school in midtern. When I went to go to school to submit an application for withdrawal from school, the road in front of my house was covered with many leaves. I felt that summer ends and fall comes closer.<br><br>It was easy to destroy my life plan in a moment. I didn't want to do everything. I wanted to just sleep in my house. I wanted to just listen to music… Something like that, I became demotivated, so when I realized I didn't go to school.</p>
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<br>
<h1>*Chapter 1:The Light and sandwiches</h1>
<p>"Lights are too bright, it's hurting my eyes…" said Leaf. "Besides…uh…are there only sandwiches? I have eaten them yesterday. The meat and vegetables were crumbly and not as delicious as I thought." He criticized various elements of them alone. He is working as store clerk after withdrawal and manage to live thanks to that. However, it is too easy for him to get stressed by working because he is a maladjusted misanthrope. Ironically, his silver-rimmed glasses probably reflects not only lights but also a hope.<br><br>Then, he heard voices. "Excuse me. Is there someone here who can take my order?" He was about to eat sandwiches in break room. He clicked his tongue at voices and went to cash register reluctantly. The convenience store don't have enough staff. He said "Hi…" and look at the customer. "Hi! How are you?" said the customer. "…It is the uniform of that high school, right?" He didn't answer about his condition, but asked to the customer. "Ah…yes." said the customer. He said "Go back your school. Summer vacation ends."  Now is October. So it is strange that a high school student visits convenience store afternoon. "Well…I skipped class. So I came here." said the customer. <br><br>In the end, the customer bought one hot dog and a cup of coffee and go back school. "My name is Rain. I'll be back." The customer just said that and then took off.

<h1>*Chapter 2:Additional order</h1>
<p>Leaf feels irritated because of lacking of a energy drink. It was daily occurrence when work is done. He wanted to pull off the uniform roughly as soon as possible.<br><br>Then, Rain truly came to the store again. "Hi." said Rain. "I came here again to see you." Leaf thought that he is kinda creepy. "Buy something and go home right away." said Leaf. He tried to swear as much as possible. However, Rain said "I want you to look at my eyes. I don't need anything." Leaf couldn't help looking at his eyes. "I knew it. Thank you!" said Rain. After that, he left soon. He didn't buy anything.
</p>

<br>
<h1>*Chapter 3:Cool with you</h1>
<p>I thought that he has eyes that same as mine. Not satisfied, not fun, and have some problems. I was very happy because I kept looking for such as person．I felt a sense of isolation. I have a lot of friends and I can get good grades on a test, but I was bored. So I skipped class and repeated going some convenience stores and coffee shops over and over again.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h1>*Chapter 4:Black headphones</h1>
<p>After work, Leaf lay on the bed and made a long arm to bring his PC and headphones on the floor. Although he was very sleepy, he wanted to make some songs. His hobby was composing music by DAW. "Before that…tsk! Kiss my ass!!" He checked views of his songs on Youtube and hit the bed. He was an unpopular writer. It showed small numbers. "Why? Don't you want only music? You want music VIDEO,too? Greedy!!" He can make songs but can't draw pictures. In the end, he started to compose while complaining because he want to be famous writer and monetize.</p>
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<br>
<h1>*Chapter 5:Bishop</h1>
<p>"Hey, you uproad some songs to Youtube, right?" said Rain. "Huh? Why do you know?" Leaf saw Rain again at the convenience store and he was very surprised because Rain knew it. "Sketchy…" said Leaf. "Listening to songs, it clicked with me that it was made by you, Leaf." said Rain. "Whatever. Sue me!" said Leaf. Suddenly, Rain showed him the screen of iPad. "Look at! Actually, I can make a short animation. I like to draw some pictues." In the screen, boys drawed by him are dancing to the music. "Ah…I can't make songs, so this music is made by other people." Leaf was keeping silent and he couldn't take his eyes off because the animation was great. "What…What are you trying to say?" said Leaf. "It's easy! Why not make songs and videos together?" said Rain. Leaf was thinking about it. Surely,the reason that his songs were not popular is lucking of uniqueness and gorgeous, so Rain may be able to make songs better if make with him. "Uh…Ok." He accepted the idea because he thought it is a chance to be famous. "Wow! I didn't expect you to accept! Thank you. We will be a good team." Rain was so excited.
</p>

<br>
<h1>*Chapter 6:Candles in cake</h1>
<p>They were a not so good team, but they made many songs and music videos. Thanks for the cooperation of Rain, numbers of view were significantly increased. At the sametime, the number of drugs that Leaf needs was increased because Insomnia gets worse in winter. "Hey, Leaf! This video's view is so great!! Sweet!!" "Wow, Ah…yes. I acknowledge that you have avility. Thank you." said Leaf. "Slay. Fuckin'savage." Without thinking, he broke out into a grin because he was able to be something of a celebrity and have many followers.<br><br>A shivery winter day, when Leaf took medicine like always, the massage was sent by Rain. "Why don't you eat cake for celebration?" He likes sweets very much, but not in that mood because he was full by many drugs. So he tried to send "No", but the doorbell rang. Opening the door, there was Rain. "Ah…Why you came?" said Leaf. "I can't wait for your massage. Let's eat!" said Rain. "Well…I don't want to eat now. Change the day." "Are you ok? You don't look so good." Rain worried. "Maybe a side effect. Don't worry. Thank you." In the end, Rain left a piece of cake for Leaf and went back his house. Leaf look at it, one candle on it. <br><br>Leaf was crushed by love and jealousy. He could be a famous youtuber, but thanks for Rain. Not only himself. Then, he was kind of aware of his love. However, He was affected with jealousy rapidly. "Damn!!" He pushed a candle into cake and smoked to be relax. His heart was a mess. </p>

<br>
<h1>*Chapter 7:Light up</h1>
<p>Leaf reached the limit because of drugs, Insomnia, smoking, and Rain. He was worn out body and soul like plants which are watered too much. He tried to go forest that he used to go to organize his thoughts, but he couldn't move. He couldn't even say anything. <br><br>Then, he came up with an idea. He suddenly moved and had a lighter. He stared at cake that Rain gave to him, and then, light to fire.</p>
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<br>
<h1>*Chapter 8:In the Monochrome Forest</h1>
<p>Rain was standing head down in the room. He couldn't think anything and move his body. He just stood in a trance. "I…What should I do?" He said. "I couldn't protect him. I couldn't, I…" It was too late to realize that He likes Leaf as more than a friend. <br><br>He came to the forest that Leaf used to tell him and set fire to a piece of paper in his hand by lighter that Leaf used and put it on leaves. He had taken it for no apparent reason when he had seen Leaf's dead body.
The forest was coverd with snow, but it wrapped in flames at the same time. Trees and leaves have gradually come to be black by the burning fire. In contrast, snow was so white. He set foot in them and felt fire. It was cold and hot. <br><br>He was eroded by the monochrome forest. There were only two color, black and white.<br><br><br>--------------------end---------------------<br><br><br></p>
